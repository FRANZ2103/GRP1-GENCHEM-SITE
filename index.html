        </div>
        <div class="child2">
            <p> In this experiment, the goal is to create a basic water filtration system using common materials to mimic the filtration process that purifies contaminated water. The materials include a plastic bottle, cotton, sand, gravel, and charcoal. The process begins by cutting the bottle in half and layering the filtration materials inside it: cotton at the bottom, followed by charcoal, sand, gravel, stones, and pebbles at the top. Contaminated water is poured through the filter, and the filtered water collected at the bottom is observed for clarity and cleanliness. This experiment helps demonstrate how different filtration materials work together to remove impurities from water, simulating the natural processes of water purification.

        </div>
        <div class="child2">
            <p>   The study, "Evaluating the Efficacy of Filtration Methods in Contaminated Water," aims to address the lack of access to clean consumable water in rural or disaster-stricken areas. In such regions, people often rely on contaminated water sources, which pose serious health risks due to waterborne diseases like cholera, dysentery, and diarrhea. The experiment seeks to answer the following question:
                
                
                1. How effective is a DIY filtration system at improving the clarity and quality of contaminated water in areas with limited access to consumable water?

    <h2>Analysis & <br> Findings</h2><br></div>
    <div class="child2">
      <p>
        As we conducted the experiment Filtration of Contaminated Water, we have observed that natural materials such as sand, charcoal, stones, and pebbles are not completely effective for filtration. And as we evaluated the efficacy of a DIY filtration system in improving the quality of contaminated water, the followings are what we have observed: <br> <br>
        
        During the first filtration, the absorption of contaminated water through the layered materials was slow, indicating that the materials were still adjusting to filtering the water. The water lightened in color but wasn't entirely clear, meaning the initial filtration removed some impurities but was not enough for significant clarity.<br> <br>
        
        In the second filtration, the absorption process became quicker, suggesting that the filtering layers had adapted. The water appeared clearer than in the first filtration, showing that multiple passes are necessary to enhance the effectiveness of the filtration system.<br> <br>
        
        By the third filtration, the water was significantly lighter but still slightly blurry. This indicates that most of the larger particles and some smaller impurities were filtered out, but fine sediments or dissolved substances still remained.<br> <br>
        
        Finally, in the fourth filtration, the blurriness cleared, and the water appeared much cleaner. At this stage, you concluded that the filtration system was effective enough for consumption. However, it didn't meet the initial expectation of producing completely clear water. The repetition of the filtration process was key to improving clarity, as each layer progressively removed more contaminants.</p>

<h2>Conclusion </h2></div>
<div class="child2">
  <p>
    Through our experiment, we observed that the water filtration process became increasingly effective with each pass, as the water clarity improved significantly after four filtrations. While the water became clearer and safe to consume, it did not reach the complete transparency we initially expected. Repeated filtration was essential to remove most impurities, proving that simple DIY filtration methods can effectively improve water quality.<br> <br>



However, for drinking purposes, it is important to note that the filtered water should be boiled before consumption to ensure it is completely safe. Boiling will eliminate any remaining harmful microorganisms that the filtration may not have fully removed.
<br> <br>


To enhance the filtration process, increasing the depth of each layer, particularly the charcoal and sand layers, would further improve the removal of contaminants and odors. Charcoal is especially effective at adsorbing impurities, and deeper layers would allow for more thorough filtration, resulting in cleaner, neutral, and odorless water. This adjustment could lead to better outcomes, achieving greater clarity and higher water quality with fewer filtration passes.
