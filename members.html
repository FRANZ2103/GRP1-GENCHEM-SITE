            <p> My name is Rhon Audrie M. Alegre from Grade 11 Stem 2, I am currently studying at Emilio Aguinaldo College - Manila. For our experiment, We tend to help people from rural and suburban places in our country. By doing this experiment, we can help by filtering the water and giving consumable water for the people to use. With this, we can teach them how to filter the water and help them with creating their own water to consume. For more details, you can message me in my account,  Good bye and thank you!
